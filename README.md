# Green Stock Analysis
## Overview
### Purpose
For this project, Steve was looking for an analysis of green stock performance over time. The initial analysis built with VBA macros in Excel analyzed the daily trading volume and stock price returns over a two-year period. Once the initial request was complete, I refactored, or edited, the scripts to run more efficiently, looping through all the data to reduce the run time for the analysis.

## Results
Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.

## Summary
Refactoring code, like this green stocks analysis, leads to better quality code, even though it doesn't add new functionality. Refactored code has the same outcome as the source code, but it more cleanly accomplishes the goal by eliminating some redundant steps. Clearly documenting the code with comments and indents will also make it easier to understand when looking back at the code at a later date. A potential disadvantage of refactoring, is any time working code is edited, there's a risk of breaking a once working solution. I made several minor errors while refactoring that I needed to debug for my analysis to run correctly. I could also see times where its imperative to deliver a working solution and a project may not have the time or budget to spend refactoring the code at the initial delivery.

How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script? What advantages of the original? 
Refactoring the original green stocks VBA script improved the script run time significantly. While the time results may not seem vast upon initial comparison, the code is now better suited to process a much larger data set, like comparing more than 12 stock tickers or more than the two years of data used in this analysis. The difference in computing speed would certainly compound and the code would run more efficiently.
