# Green Stock Analysis
## Overview
### Purpose
Steve requested an analysis of green stock tickers for several years of data. The initial analysis was build using VBA macros in Excel to look aggregate stock returns over time. Once complete, the initial code was refactored, or edited, to run more efficiently, using more strategic loops and arrays to reduce the run time for the analysis.

## Results
Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.

## Summary
What are the advantages or disadvantges of refactoring code?


How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
While the original script did not take too much more time or processing power, if processing a much larger data set (perhaps more stock tickers or more than the two years of data used in this analysis), the difference in computing speed would certainly compound and run more efficiently.
